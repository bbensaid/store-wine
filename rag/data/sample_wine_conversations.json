      "body": "Congratulations on your 10th anniversary! What a special occasion. For your romantic dinner with filet mignon and lobster, I have some excellent recommendations within your budget:\n\nFor the filet mignon, I recommend our 2019 Domaine Tempier Bandol ($65) - a beautiful French red with soft tannins that will complement the tender meat perfectly.\n\nFor the lobster, our 2020 Chablis ($45) is ideal - crisp and mineral-driven, it won't overpower the delicate seafood.\n\nTotal: $110, which fits perfectly in your budget. Both wines are in stock and can be shipped tomorrow for delivery by Friday.\n\nWould you like me to add these to your cart, or do you have any questions about these selections?\n\nBest regards,\nSarah, Head Sommelier"

      "body": "Excellent question! Proper storage is crucial for maintaining your wine collection, especially with those premium Bordeaux and Burgundy wines.\n\nHere are the optimal conditions for your wine cellar:\n\nTemperature: 55-65°F (13-18°C)\n- Keep it consistent - temperature fluctuations are the enemy\n- 55°F is ideal for long-term aging\n\nHumidity: 60-70%\n- Prevents corks from drying out\n- Too high can cause mold, too low dries out corks\n\nStorage position: Horizontal\n- Keeps corks moist and prevents oxidation\n\nFor your collection:\n- Bordeaux: Can age 10-20+ years in proper conditions\n- Burgundy: Generally 5-15 years depending on the producer\n- Most wines peak within 2-3 years of purchase\n\nI'd be happy to help you organize your cellar by aging potential. Would you like me to create a storage plan for your collection?\n\nBest regards,\nSarah, Head Sommelier"
