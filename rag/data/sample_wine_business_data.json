    "content": "Wine Pairing Guide for Filet Mignon: Filet mignon pairs beautifully with full-bodied red wines. Our top recommendations are: 1) Cabernet Sauvignon - The tannins cut through the richness of the meat. Try our 2019 Château Margaux ($450) or 2020 Stag's Leap Cabernet ($85). 2) Merlot - Softer tannins complement the tender meat. Our 2019 Domaine Tempier Bandol ($65) is perfect. 3) Pinot Noir - Lighter option that won't overpower the delicate flavor. The 2021 Oregon Pinot Noir ($45) is excellent. For special occasions like anniversaries, we recommend the Château Margaux. Budget-friendly options include the Oregon Pinot Noir.",

Avoid temperature fluctuations and direct sunlight. For long-term storage (over 1 year), invest in a wine cellar or wine refrigerator. Short-term storage (under 6 months) can be done in a cool, dark closet. Red wines can be stored longer than whites. Most wines are best consumed within 2-3 years of purchase, except for premium Bordeaux and Burgundy which can age 10+ years.",
